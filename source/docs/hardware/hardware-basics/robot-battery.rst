Robot Battery
=============

The power supply for an FRC\ |reg| robot is a single 12V 18Ah battery. The batteries used for FRC are sealed lead acid batteries capable of meeting the high current demands of an FRC robot.

Battery Longevity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This battery is rated for about 1200 charge/recharge cycles, but for the high currents FRC subjects it to that lifespan is reduced to about 400 cycles.  These cycles are intended to be relatively limited discharge and deep cycling the battery (running it all the way down) can damage it.

These batteries last the longest if they are kept fully charged when not it use.  Take care however to not leave them on a trickle charger for an extended period of time.

Dropped batteries are also the cause of many early failures and the batteries should be handled with care.

Battery Connections

Great care should be taken when handling the batteries.  DO NOT CARRY THE BATTERY BY THE CABLES
